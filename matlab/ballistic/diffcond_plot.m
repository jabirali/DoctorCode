function diffcond_plot(transmission, polarization, phaseshift, scattering, temperature)
  % Calculates and plots the differential conductance as function of voltage for
  % a ballistic superconductor/normal-metal bilayer with a spin-active tunneling
  % interface between a superconductor and normal metal. 
  %
  % The input parameters are:
  %   transmission  --  Interfacial transmission (range [ 0,1])                     [scalar]
  %   polarization  --  Interfacial polarization (range [-1,1])                     [scalar]
  %   phaseshift    --  Spin-dependent interfacial phase shift (normalized to pi)   [scalar]
  %   scattering    --  Inelastic scattering rate (normalized to the zero-temp gap) [scalar]
  %   temperature   --  Temperature of the system (normalized to the critical temp) [vector]

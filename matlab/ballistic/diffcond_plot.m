function diffcond_plot(transmission, polarization, scattering, temperature)
  % Calculates and plots the differential conductance as function of voltage for
  % a ballistic superconductor/normal-metal bilayer with a spin-active tunneling
  % interface. The temperature, transmission probability, spin-polarization, and
  % inelastic scattering rate must be specified as arguments. The temperature is
  % normalized to the superconducting critical temperature Tc, and the inelastic
  % scattering is an imaginary energy term normalized to the superconducting gap.

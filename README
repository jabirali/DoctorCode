Superconducting Spintronics Simulation Suite in Fortran (s4tran)

The project requires features from Fortran 2008, which have been successfully tested with GFortran version 5.1+.

To compile the project in release mode, which enables full optimization and thus provides the best performance, run:
    cmake .
    make

To compile the project in debug mode, run the commands:
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make
Note that compiling the project in debug mode will make it significantly slower; typical applications require around
twice the computation time of similar applications compiled in release mode. However, as the name implies, this also
makes it significantly easier to debug the program, as it enables the use of the GDB debugger and GProf profiler, as
well as several runtime checks (such as checking that array indices are within allowed bounds).

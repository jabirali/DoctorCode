Superconducting Spintronics Simulation Suite in Fortran (s4tran)

INTRODUCTION

USAGE

Use the syntax ./bin/command [option1=value1 [option2=value2 [...]]] to specify command line arguments, where square brackets denote optional arguments.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Note that the project requires features from Fortran 2008, and thus requires a relatively recent compiler. It has been
successfully tested using gfortran from the GNU Compiler Collection version 4.9.1+, but has primarily been tested with
version 5.2+. It may also compile successfully using other recent compilers such as the Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort)
and Oracle Solaris Studio (sunf95),  but this would require some modification of the compiler flags in CMakeLists.txt
to match the given compiler.  The essential requirement would be to specify that src/external/bvp_la.f is a fixed-form
F77 file; src/external/bvp_m.f and src/external/pchip.f are free-form F90 files; and all the other files are free-form 
F2008 files.  The project should not depend on any preinstalled external libraries (including MPI, BLAS, LAPACK, etc.),
so the only system-side requirement should be a somewhat recent Fortran compiler.  If you manage to compile the project
using a compiler other than gfortran, I would appreciate any comments on how it went (compiler flags, warnings, errors),
so that I may update the project files accordingly.

COMPILING
To compile the project in release mode, which enables full optimization and thus provides the best performance, run:
    cmake .
    make

To compile the project in debug mode, run the commands:
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make
Note that compiling the project in debug mode will make it significantly slower; typical applications require around
twice the computation time of similar applications compiled in release mode. However, as the name implies, this also
makes it significantly easier to debug the program, as it enables the use of the GDB debugger and GProf profiler, as
well as several runtime checks (such as checking that array indices are within allowed bounds).

LICENCE
External files have their own licences. Link to netlib.

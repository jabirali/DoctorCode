Superconducting Spintronics Simulation Suite in Fortran (s4tran)

The project requires features from Fortran 2008, which have been successfully tested with GFortran version 5.1+.

To compile the project in release mode (enable optimizations):
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
    make

To compile the project in debug mode (disable optimizations, enable debug symbols):
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make

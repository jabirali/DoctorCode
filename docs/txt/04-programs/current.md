This program does something. Fill in details.

    ./bin/current

@NOTE
  This program should only be used if you either (i) need to determine the critical current,
  precisely, or (ii) need to map the entire current-phase relation. If you just want to find
  the currents in a Josephson junction for some given phase difference (e.g. Ï€/2), it is much 
  more efficient to execute the `equilibrium` program with locked superconductors at the edges.

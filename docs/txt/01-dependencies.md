To compile the project, any [Fortran compiler](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Compilers) that supports the official language standards from 1977 through 2008 should suffice.
However, the software has been developed and tested using the compilers below.
For your own convenience, it is therefore recommended that you have the following available:

 * [CMake](https://cmake.org/):
   an open-source cross-platform build system that automates the compilation details;
 * [GFortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran):
   an open-source cross-platform Fortran compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection;
 * [IFort](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers):
   a commercial Fortran compiler developed by Intel, with free licenses for e.g. [students](https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/student).

The code was last tested using GFortran 8.2.0, IFort 18.0.2, and CMake 3.10.2.
Newer versions should probably work fine, while older versions may or may not work.
The software was originally developed using GFortran 5.0 and CMake 2.6, and later tested rigorously with IFort 16.0.
However, newer versions of the software increasingly relies on modern language features, which may be unavailable or unreliable on older compilers.

In my experience, IFort generates much faster binaries than GFortran:
with the most aggressive optimalization settings, IFort binaries run ~4x faster on an Intel Core i7.
Furthermore, the nonequilibrium functionality in particular has been tested more rigorously using IFort.
However, if you do not have access to IFort, the code should work fine with GFortran too, so no proprietary tools are strictly required.

Although slower, the binaries generated by GFortran can sometimes be more stable than the ones generated by IFort.
In most cases, this is just caused by IFort choosing to place more variables on the stack than GFortran.
In that case, the problem can be resolved by running the command `ulimit -s unlimited` to increase the stack size, assuming that you use a Linux/Unix system with a Bourne-based shell.

There are also some optional but recommended programs:

 * This documentation was automatically generated by [FORD](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford), based on the source code and some supplementary [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.
   This program should be installed if you plan to modify the source code, and wish to automatically update the documentation accordingly.
 * The output formats are designed to be easy to plot with [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).
   For examples of how to generate publication-quality plots with Gnuplot, see e.g. [this page](http://www.gnuplotting.org/).
   However, it should also be straight-forward to import the generated data to e.g. Matlab, Python, or R, if you prefer that.

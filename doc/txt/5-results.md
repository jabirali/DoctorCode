All data files produced by the simulations are exported as numerical tables
in a simple tab-delimited text file, with the top row documenting the output
format. These results should be easy to import and plot in any common plotting
environment.

If you have [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) on your system, then you can
also reuse my existing plotting scripts to display the output data:

    ./bin/disp filename.dat

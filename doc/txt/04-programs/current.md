This program does something. Fill in details.

    ./bin/current

@NOTE
  This program should only be used if you either (i) need to determine the critical current
  precisely, or (ii) need to map the entire current-phase relation of a Josephson junction.
  If you only want to calculate the currents in a Josephson junction for some given phase
  difference, e.g. Ï€/2, then it is much more efficient to execute the `equilibrium` program
  with two locked superconductors and a fixed phase difference as the boundary conditions.

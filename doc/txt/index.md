Start by checking if your system satisfies the [list of dependencies](01-dependencies.html),
and then move on to the [compilation instructions](02-compilation.html). After that, you can
learn about the format of the configuration files used to describe relevant physical systems
[here](03-config/index.html), and about each particular program [here](04-programs/index.html).

Here is a simple test of integrating \(\gamma\)'s and \(\tilde\gamma\)'s in MathJax:
\[
  \hat{g}^{\mathrm{R}} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
     \phantom{-}N(1+\gamma\tilde\gamma) &
     \phantom{-}2N\gamma                \\
              - 2\tilde{N}\tilde\gamma  & 
              - \tilde{N}(1+\tilde\gamma\gamma) \\
  \end{pmatrix}
\]

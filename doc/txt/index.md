@NOTE The documentation is currently both incomplete and out-of-date. An update is coming.

This code was written as part of my doctoral research in theoretical condensed matter physics.
This research was supervised by [Prof. Jacob Linder](https://folk.ntnu.no/jacobrun/), and took
place at the [Center for Quantum Spintronics](https://www.ntnu.edu/quspin), NTNU, Norway.

Start by checking if your system satisfies the [list of dependencies](01-dependencies.html),
and then move on to the [compilation instructions](02-compilation.html). After that, you can
learn about the format of the configuration files used to describe relevant physical systems
[here](03-config/index.html), and about each particular program [here](04-programs/index.html).

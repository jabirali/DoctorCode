- Extend mod_spin with spin(3) vector methods, such as spin3_exp_integer and spin3_add_spin3, to simplify the ferromagnet_usadel_equation and spinorbit_usadel_equation implementations
- Extend energy_range to include the possibility of negative energies
- Extend the ferromagnet constructor to allow exchange field initialization from a function
- Use namelists to construct and read config files
- Move spinorbit_* and spinactive_* to submodules when GFortran supports it
- Find a sensible way to append results to a file from critical temp calculations.
- Improve output routines (inspired by CMake â€” red headers, yellow warnings, green status info, calculate percentage complete)
